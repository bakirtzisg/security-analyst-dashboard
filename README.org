** About the paper

  Georgios Bakirtzis, Brandon Simon, Cody Fleming, and Carl Elks,
  "Looking for a Black Cat in a Dark Room: Security Visualization
  for Cyber-Physical System Design and Analysis," [[https://vizsec.org/vizsec2018/][IEEE VizSec 2018]]
  [[[https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08081][preprint]]|[[https://vimeo.com/308133381][talk]]]

** Getting Started

   This project works in conjunction with [[https://github.com/bakirtzisg/cybok-cli][cybok-cli]]
   & [[https://github.com/bakirtzisg/graphml_export][graphml_export]]---which produce the data requirements for this project.

** Prerequisites

   The following are required to run the dashboard:
   Java JDK 8, Python >=3.6.4 and the rest
   of [[https://github.com/bakirtzisg/cybok-cli][cybok-cli]]'s prerequisites.

** Building and Running

   The following script will automatically initialize
   the =cybok-cli= submodule, compile the code if needed,
   and start the security analyst dashboard.

   Windows:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   $./build_and_run.bat
   #+END_SRC

   GNU/Linux or macOS:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   $./build_and_run.sh
   #+END_SRC

** Usage

   Once running the dashboard first checks two things: (1) that a correct version
   of python is installed and (2) that a correct installation of =cybok-cli= exists
   within the repo.
   In the event that either of those checks fail, the dashboard will terminate.

   At first launch, the user is prompt to update the data requirements
   of =cybok-cli=.
   If the data does not exist, it populates the correct structures
   within =cybok-cli=.
   (Unfortunately both these actions take some time at the moment, please be patient.)
   Without this step the dashboard will not operate properly.

*** Accepted Models

    The dashboard is agnostic to modeling tool as long as a GraphML file is provided.
    There two models that input into the dashboard: (1) system topology graph
    and (2) specification graph.
    The specification is optional, only the system topology graph is necessary.

    For the system topology graph model you can look at this paper:

    Georgios Bakirtzis, Bryan T. Carter, Carl R. Elks, and Cody H. Fleming,
    "A Model-Based Approach to Security Analysis for Cyber-Physical Systems,"
    [[http://2018.ieeesyscon.org/][IEEE SysCon 2018]] [[[https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11442][preprint]], [[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8369518][proceedings]]]

    Briefly the following schema is used for the system topology:

    | Attribute        | Description                                   |
    |------------------+-----------------------------------------------|
    | Entry Points     | How external devices interact with the system |
    | Software         | What software the vertex uses                 |
    | Firmware         | What firmware the vertex uses                 |
    | Operating System | What operating system the vertex uses         |
    | Device           | The device name that the vertex is            |
    | Communication    | What protocol is used in an edge              |

    and this one for the specification graph

    | Attribute   | Description                                          |
    |-------------+------------------------------------------------------|
    | Type        | Type of requirement; Structure, Mission, or Function |
    | Description | Description of the requirement                       |

    For specifics on writing such GraphML files you can look in the =data= folder.
